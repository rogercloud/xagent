"""Auth dependency for ``/v1/*`` endpoints.

``get_agent_from_api_key`` resolves the ``Authorization: Bearer
xag_<prefix>_<secret>`` header to the bound :class:`Agent` row,
returning ``(Agent, AgentApiKey)`` on success and raising
:class:`V1ApiError` ``invalid_api_key`` (HTTP 401) on every failure
path.

Failure paths intentionally share the same response code and burn the
same ~100ms of bcrypt work (via :func:`verify_dummy`) regardless of
which check failed:

  - Missing / malformed header
  - Prefix not in DB
  - Secret doesn't match the stored bcrypt hash
  - Bound agent row missing (orphan key, shouldn't happen but defended)

Without this symmetry, an attacker could enumerate live prefixes by
timing the response (slow = bcrypt ran = prefix exists; fast = index
miss = prefix doesn't exist). See SDK design doc §7 (key format and
auth flow) and §10 (security considerations).

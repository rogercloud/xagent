"""Interruption bookkeeping for automatic task recovery.

When a run is interrupted rather than finished, the settling transaction
records why in ``task_auto_recovery`` (one row per task) and appends a
``task_recovery_events`` row. Those rows are metadata only: nothing here
changes a task's status, control state, error message or lifecycle
projections, which stay the settling writer's own decision.

Phase 1 has no executor, so a recorded interruption is never ``scheduled``.
Its state says only who may resume the run: ``manual`` (the user, from the
PAUSED task), ``ineligible`` (a task kind automatic recovery will never
touch) or ``disabled`` (``XAGENT_TASK_INFRA_FAILURE_PAUSE_ENABLED`` is off).

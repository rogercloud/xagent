    This is the one place that decides "is this a URL this connector
    trusts as its own Drive share link", shared by _resolve_file_id and
    _extract_resource_key so that decision can't drift between them.
    Before this was factored out, the two functions each carried their
    own copy of this logic, and they *did* silently disagree: a
    published-to-web "/d/e/" link that _resolve_file_id correctly refuses
    to resolve an id for was nonetheless treated as trusted enough by
    _extract_resource_key to pull a resourcekey out of -- the id-shape
    exclusion lived only in _resolve_file_id's copy. Sharing this parse
    step means a future fix to the trust decision (a new excluded shape,
    another parser-differential case, etc.) applies to both call sites at
    once instead of needing to be found and re-applied twice.

    urlparse only populates ``.scheme``/``.netloc`` for a string with an
    explicit "scheme://" prefix (or at least a leading "//"): a scheme-less
    "evil.com/file/d/<id>/view" (at least as natural a shape for an
    attacker to plant in text an agent reads as a full https:// URL) would
    otherwise parse with no netloc and slip past a naive urlparse(value)
    check. Retrying with a "//" prefix only when the *first* parse found no
    netloc (rather than keying off whether "//" occurs anywhere in the
    string) correctly handles a scheme-less link that itself contains a
    nested "https://" further in, e.g. in a "continue=" query value.

    A userinfo-bearing authority ("evil.com@drive.google.com", or the same
    thing with a literal backslash before the "@") is inherently
    ambiguous: Python's parser (correctly, per RFC 3986) treats everything
    before the last "@" as userinfo and resolves .hostname to the part
    after it, so this would pass the trusted-host check below -- but a
    WHATWG-based parser (e.g. a browser rendering this same string to a
    human, or a different URL consumer downstream) can disagree about
    which side is the real destination. Reject outright rather than trust
    a parse that other consumers of the same string might not agree with.

    A flat item-level cut (_capped_list_response's default halving)
    can't be paired safely with a resumable page token: Drive's
    ``pageToken`` only resumes at a page boundary, so if size-capping
    dropped items from *inside* an already-fetched page, a
    next_page_token that only ever points past whole pages would skip
    those dropped items forever, even though they were already fetched
    from the API this call. Dropping only whole pages avoids that: the
    first dropped page's own start token is always available as the
    resume point, so a caller who follows next_page_token is guaranteed
    to see every permission again (at worst once more, never zero
    times).

    If even the single earliest remaining page doesn't fit under the cap
    on its own, this falls back to _capped_list_response's plain
    item-level cut of just that page's contents -- and deliberately never
    passes a next_page_token through to it in that case. This isn't an
    oversight: at that point every candidate token is unsafe to offer --
    ``pages[1][0]`` (the next already-fetched page's start) would skip
    whatever this fallback had to cut from the *current* page, and this
    page's own start token would just refetch the same too-big page
    again. A cut inside one page has no page-granular resume point that
    doesn't silently skip something, so omitting the token entirely is
    the honest answer, not a simplification worth "fixing" by wiring one
    of those back in.

    ``pages`` is the ordered list of ``(start_token, items)`` fetched
    this call; ``next_page_token`` is the token for whatever page comes
    after the LAST page in ``pages`` (``None`` if that was Drive's last
    page). ``max_output_length`` lets a caller that already read it (e.g.
    to drive its own fetch-loop early-exit) pass the same value through

    directly to another tool that reads local files, e.g. gmail_send_messages's
    'attachments'. A downloaded Excel (.xlsx), Word (.docx) or PDF file can
    be read with read_file, and a PowerPoint (.pptx) file with read_pptx,
    when those tools are available. read_file chooses how to read a file by
    its extension, so the saved name must keep the file's own extension
    (for example .xlsx, .docx or .pdf). If the returned path has no
    extension at all (an uploaded file whose Drive name has none), download
    the file again with a filename that adds the extension of its returned
    mimeType (see filename).

    mime_type: required when file_id is a Google Workspace document (Docs,
    Sheets, Slides) — the format to export to (e.g. "application/pdf").
    Ignored for a file that already has real binary content of its own
    (mime_type is not required and has no effect there).
    filename: optional name for the written file; defaults to the Drive

    filename="report" for an "application/pdf" export still ends up

    saved under the filename, or its Drive name, as it is. So a filename
    given here must keep the file's own extension (e.g. "report.xlsx", not
    "report"), and a file whose Drive name has no extension needs a
    filename that adds one.

    The result's "file" also carries modifiedTime, version, shared, driveId

    into the task workspace (e.g. an exported PDF report).

    file_path: path to a file already on disk, e.g. something written to
    the task workspace. Must be inside an allowed directory (automatically
    scoped to the current task workspace), which is meant to keep this
    tool from reading arbitrary host files — not an absolute guarantee
    (see this function's own symlink-timing comment on the `with
    local_path.open("rb")` line below). Pass an absolute path — a relative
    path resolves against this process's own working directory, not the
    allowed directory, and will not find a file written to the task
    workspace.
    name: the file name to give it in Drive; defaults to file_path's own
    basename.
    mime_type: defaults to a guess from the file's extension via the
    standard mimetypes module, falling back to "application/octet-stream"
    when it can't be guessed. This guess is informational only — Drive's
    displayed file type may be wrong on a host whose mimetypes database
    doesn't recognize the extension (see the _KNOWN_TEXT_EXTENSIONS
    comment above for why that's host-dependent), but the uploaded bytes
    are always exactly file_path's real content either way. Pass mime_type
    explicitly for a reliable label, especially for an extension outside
    the common formats mimetypes ships with by default.

    its name.  The source

    non-folder destinations fail without mutating anything. The update response
    is validated before reporting success.

    ``new_name`` optionally renames the item in the same update, including
    when it is already in the destination folder. Leave it empty to keep the

    was already in that folder, so it was not moved) and ``renamed`` (true

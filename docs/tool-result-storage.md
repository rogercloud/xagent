# Stored tool results

When a tool returns a result that is too long for the model's context, xagent
can store the long part in a file in the task workspace instead of cutting it
off. The model sees a short placeholder and a notice naming the stored file,
and reads the file back with the `read_tool_result` tool.

## When a result is stored

Storing is enabled for a tool set only when it contains a `read_tool_result`
tool bound to a real task workspace. A tool set without one -- no file tools,
the tool-listing endpoint's mock workspace, or a tool policy that removes
`read_tool_result` -- keeps the ordinary behavior: every string longer than
the limit is truncated. Building such a tool set logs one INFO line starting
with `Tool result spill disabled:`.

The limit is `XAGENT_TOOL_MAX_OUTPUT_LENGTH` (characters, default 51200).
Only dict results are stored. For a dict result:

- Each value inside it whose JSON form is longer than the limit is stored in
  its own file and replaced by a placeholder, at most
  `SPILL_MAX_FILES_PER_RESULT` (8) files per result.
- If no single value is over the limit but the whole result is, the whole
  result is stored in one file. Every key is kept; a value longer than the
  placeholder is replaced by it, except fields listed in
  `SPILL_ENVELOPE_KEYS` (such as `status`, `error` and `output`).
- Results that wait for user input, classified tool failures and file
  references are never stored. Binary values are left to ordinary filtering.

One tool set stores at most `SPILL_MAX_FILES_PER_RUN` (64) files; after
that, over-long values are truncated as before. One file holds at most
`SPILL_MAX_FILE_BYTES` (8 MiB); a longer value is cut at an item or line
boundary, and the notice says how many items were stored.

## Where files go

Files are written to `output/tool-results/` inside the task workspace, named
`<tool name>-<digest>.json` for arrays and objects and
`<tool name>-<digest>.txt` for everything else. The tool-name prefix is
reduced to letters, digits, `_` and `-` and cut to 64 characters; the digest
is the first 32 hex characters of the SHA-256 of the file's bytes. The model
refers to a file as `tool-results/<name>`. The directory belongs to the task,
so a later run of the same task can list files an earlier run stored. These
files are not part of the task's output file list.

## Reading a stored result back

The ReAct pattern offers `read_tool_result` to the model once the run has
registered at least one stored result. It has three uses:

- No `path`: list the stored files by path and size, a page of at most
  `SPILL_MAX_FILES_PER_RUN` entries; `start` and `end` pick entry numbers.
- `path` only: read the whole stored result.
- `path` with `start` and `end`: read items `start` to `end` (1-based,
  inclusive). An item is an array element, a top-level object entry, or a
  line of text, depending on the file's content. `offset` is a 0-based
  character position inside the selected text, used to continue reading an
  item longer than one reply.

One reply returns at most `SPILL_READ_MAX_CHARS` (12000) characters. A
longer selection returns a preview that says where it starts, how long the
whole text is, and whether more follows. A file that is gone, or whose bytes
no longer match the digest in its name, is reported as unavailable.

## Settings and limits

- `XAGENT_TOOL_MAX_OUTPUT_LENGTH` (environment, see `example.env`): the
  per-string truncation limit and the storing threshold.
- `SPILL_MAX_FILES_PER_RESULT`, `SPILL_MAX_FILES_PER_RUN`,
  `SPILL_MAX_FILE_BYTES` and `SPILL_READ_MAX_CHARS` are constants in
  `src/xagent/core/tools/tool_result_spill.py`, not settings.

## Known limitations

- Only dict results are stored. A tool that returns a plain string or a list
  is truncated as before.
- The reply of `read_tool_result` goes through the same output filter and is
  never stored again. If `XAGENT_TOOL_MAX_OUTPUT_LENGTH` is below
  `SPILL_READ_MAX_CHARS`, a longer read-back is truncated by that filter, so
  the model receives less than one full reply per call.
